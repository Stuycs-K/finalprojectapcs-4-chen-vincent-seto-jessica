PENTRiX -- This is the classic Tetris, but instead of tetrominoes we use pentominoes (5 tiles per block!) which leads to more variation and some added difficulty. This would have the standard key options (soft drop, hard drop, rotate right, etc.) as well as the different line clears (with appropriate scores attached) and high score tracking, and we may also try to make the standard Tetris as another option if time permits.

**Expanded Description:**
After 1.5 weeks, we hope to have a working Tetris and its 5-block counterpart. Mainly, we hope to create adequate centering and a working board that is aesthetically pleasing and functional; additional goals include functional rotation and dropping (as well as any other appropriate methods), as well as potential fun add-ons (maybe skills and/or power-ups?). 

To do this, we would have a class for the pieces as well as a 2D array/board for the slots that are filled by blocks, with appropriate colors as needed.
