## Jessica Seto

### May 21st
Drafted block and fixed UML diagrams

### May 23rd
Editied Block class a bit and started on pieces

### May 27th
Helped Vincent fix the board class and render, and also figured out why the pieces wasn't working (I can't have the templates be static)

### May 27th Homework
Tweaked Piece and Block class and got a test piece to spawn in correctly, changed x and y into r and c, alongside drafting a canFit() to check whether or not it a piece can move into a new position

### May 28th In-class
Unreversed the rows and columns in pieces, got single drop working, fixed the canFit a bit but did not rigorosly test anything yet
