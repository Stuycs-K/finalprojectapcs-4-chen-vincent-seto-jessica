Vincent Chen & Jessica Seto

Yet another Tetris Team

PENTRiX -- This is the classic Tetris, but instead of tetrominoes we use pentominoes (5 tiles per block!) which leads to more variation and some added difficulty. This would have the standard key options (soft drop, hard drop, rotate right, etc.) as well as the different line clears (with appropriate scores attached) and high score tracking, and we may also try to make the standard Tetris as another option if time permits. Link to tetris: https://play.tetris.com/

**Expanded Description:**

After 1.5 weeks, we hope to have a working Tetris and its 5-block counterpart. Mainly, we hope to create adequate centering and a working board that is aesthetically pleasing and functional; additional goals include functional rotation and dropping (as well as any other appropriate methods), as well as potential fun add-ons (maybe skills and/or power-ups?).

## Things Strictly Necessary:
- :white_check_mark: Clear line after filled
- :white_check_mark: Falling pieces (and quick drop)
- :white_check_mark: rotation
- :white_check_mark: moving left and right
- :white_check_mark: Score tracking
- :white_check_mark: Colorful pieces

## Thins that would be nice to have
- ~~Animations when clearing a row?~~ we werent able to figure out animations
-:white_check_mark: (new) Powerups (freeze, score, stash)
- :white_check_mark: Arraylist of next pieces (new; because this is apparently in regular tetris)
- :white_check_mark: ability to stash pieces (new; becaue this is also in regular tetris)
- ~~Maybe different modes with different types of boards (or other experimental modes like one where pieces spawn in the middle and you can stick them on the walls/ceilings)~~ our new mode idea was the powerups

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


![UML DIAGRAM](UML.png?raw=true "UML diagrams, containing all relevant classes and their variables." )


Block Class
- int row, col for position
- String type (either "fallen", "empty", "wall" or "falling")
- Color color
- Piece piece //the piece the block belongs to
- String powerup (new) -> 1% chance at being one of 3 powerups at random
- and the corresponding getters of these fields
- ~~clone() to return a copy of the block~~ wound up just constructing a new one with the same features
- int getCOffset(), int getROffset() to get the column or row displacement/offset of the block
- (new) images for powerups and loading of those images

Piece Class
- int r,c for the row and column of the center block
- ArrayList<Block>() blocks of the blocks it is made of
- canFit(r, c,orientation) returns if that orientation and spot is a valid spot for the new center on the board (previously isValid())
- ~~Move(r, c) moves the piece on the board after checking if it is valid.~~
- Remove and add piece to board (new) replaced Move(r,c)
- moveleft, moveright moves the piece
- dropOne drops the piece and returns wherher or not ut was successful
- fullDrop() runs Drop until it hits the bottom, and coinverts appropriate blocks
- rotate() will ~~cycle through the rotations that will be generated by math.~~ generste a new rotation via math (decided it was simpler this way)
  
Board Class
- board (blocks[][]) starts out as all empty except for some wall blocks
- piece currentFallingPiece points to the currently falling piece
- ArrayList<Piece> nextpieces show next 3 pieces
- piece spawnPiece() spawns a new piece
- void render() makes the board show up in a pretty way on the screen
- void tick() drops falling block and checks for filled rows
- clearRow() removes all fallen blocks in that row
- (new) checkEmpty checks if a slot is empty

Game class
- Board board for board w/ all data
- Piece current for the currently falling piece
- piece stashed for the stashed piece
- boolean gameOver for when game ends
- int drop/clear/pieceScore: Score accumulated by dropping pieces manually or quickly/rows cleared/# pieces spawned.
- void setup(), tick(), and draw() to initialize and advance/update the game screen
-  keyPressed() to rotate and stash and move the pieces (left/right, or dropping)
- void score() to help track score
- spawnPiece() 
- (new) render methods for things like powerups, queue of pieces and stash area

# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. 

## MVP timeline:

1-2 days
:white_check_mark: Block class + Simple constructor of pieces (just a straight piece) for testing other methods and as many other pieces as I can get done + game class: Jessica
:white_check_mark: Board class constructor + render method: Vincent

Days 3-4
:white_check_mark: isValid, down translation, rotation: Jessica
:white_check_mark: More constructors for pieces : Vincent

Day 5-6:
:white_check_mark: Creation/constructor of rest of pieces: Jessica
:white_check_mark:Quickdrop, sideways translation: Vincent

Day 7-8:
:white_check_mark: Game loop and decoration.
