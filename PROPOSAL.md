# IDEAS:

1 PENTRiX -- This is the classic Tetris, but instead of tetrominoes we use pentominoes (5 tiles per block!) which leads to more variation and some added difficulty. This would have the standard key options (soft drop, hard drop, rotate right, etc.) as well as the different line clears (with appropriate scores attached) and high score tracking, and we may also try to make the standard Tetris as another option if time permits.

2 FireBoy and WaterGirl -- this is the CoolMathGames game, where two characters are made of fire and water and need to get to their respective exit to escape the temple. This would feature levers, buttons, boxes, etc. as well as a timer to track amount of playing time.

3 Chess -- we're trying to replicate the classic chess, with 64 squares and 16 pieces on each side (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn). We may also try to make a 3 or 4-player version, if time permits, allow players to add the number of pieces they would like to the board before playing, and/or a clock to track playing time.
