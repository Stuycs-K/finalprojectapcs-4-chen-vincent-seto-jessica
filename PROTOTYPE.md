Period 4

Vincent Chen & Jessica Seto
Yet another Tetris Team

PENTRiX -- This is the classic Tetris, but instead of tetrominoes we use pentominoes (5 tiles per block!) which leads to more variation and some added difficulty. This would have the standard key options (soft drop, hard drop, rotate right, etc.) as well as the different line clears (with appropriate scores attached) and high score tracking, and we may also try to make the standard Tetris as another option if time permits. Link to tetris: https://play.tetris.com/

**Expanded Description:**

After 1.5 weeks, we hope to have a working Tetris and its 5-block counterpart. Mainly, we hope to create adequate centering and a working board that is aesthetically pleasing and functional; additional goals include functional rotation and dropping (as well as any other appropriate methods), as well as potential fun add-ons (maybe skills and/or power-ups?).

## Things Strictly Necessary:
- Clear line after filled
- Falling pieces (and quick drop)
- rotation
- moving left and right
- Score tracking
- Colorful pieces

## Thins that would be nice to have
- Animations when clearing a row?
- Maybe different modes with different types of boards (or other experimental modes like one where pieces spawn in the middle and you can stick them on the walls/ceilings)

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.

![UML DIAGRAM](UML.png?raw=true "UML diagrams, containing all relevant classes and their variables." )

Block Class
- String type (either "fallen", "empty", "wall" or "falling")
- Color color
- Piece piece //the piece the block belongs to
- and the corresponding getters of these fields

Piece Class
- int r,c for the row and column of centerpiece
- ArrayList<Block>() blocks of the blocks it is made of
- isValid(r, c,orientation) returns if that orientation and spot is a valid spot for the new center on the board
- Move(r, c) moves the piece on  the board after checking if it is valid.
- Drop, moveleft, moveright moves the piece
- fullDrop() runs Drop until it hits the bottom, and coinverts appropriate blocks
- rotate() will cycle through the rotations that will be generated by math.

Board Class
- board (blocks[][]) starts out as all empty except for some wall blocks
- piece currentFallingPiece points to the currently falling piece
- piece spawnPiece() spawns a new piece
- void render() makes the board show up in a pretty way on the screen
- void tick() drops falling block and checks for filled rows
- clearRow() removes all fallen blocks in that row

# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

1-2 days
Block class + Simple constructor of pieces (just a straight piece) for testing other methods and as many other pieces as I can get done + game class: Jessica
Board class constructor + render method: Vincent

Days 3-4
Rotation: Jessica
Creation/constructor of rest of pieces: Vincent

Day 5-6:
isValid and quickdrop: Vincent
translation for pieces (Ideally including up translations for potential expansion): Jessica

Day 7-8:
Game loop and decoration.
